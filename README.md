A React Web application that presents Winston Outlet Partners.

## Access
Demo Link: https://winston.netlify.com/

**Required Parameters:**

The `secret` parameter is needed on the url in order to gain access. This is because since Winston is a cigarrette company, we needed a flow to confirm that users visiting the site are above 18 years old. 

The `name` parameter will allow personalization for the user once they load the Winston Partners app. 

A simple way this secret & name is provided is through a QR Code like this below:
